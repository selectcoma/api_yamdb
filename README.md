**Project YaMDb**

YaMDb Project

The YaMDb project collects user reviews.

There are different categories like: "Books", "Films", "Music".

The list of categories (Category) can be expanded (for example, you can add the category "Fine Arts" or "Jewelry").

The works themselves are not stored in YaMDb; you cannot watch a movie or listen to music here.

**API YaMDb Resources **

YaMDb API Resources

USERS: users.

TITLES: titles that are being reviewed (a specific movie, book or song).

CATEGORIES: categories (types) of works ("Films", "Books", "Music").

GENRES: genres of works. One work can be linked to several genres.

REVIEWS: reviews of works. The review is tied to a specific work.

COMMENTS: Comments on reviews. The comment is linked to a specific review.

**User registration algorithm**

- The user sends a POST request with the parameters username and email to / api / v1 / auth / email /

- Yamdb sends an email with a confirmation code to the entered email address.
  
- The user sends a POST request with the parameters username and confirmation_code (received by mail) to / api / v1 / auth / token /

- In response to the request, he receives a token (JWT token). These operations are performed once, when a user is registered.
  
- As a result, the user receives a token and can work with the API, sending this token with each request.Для обновления токена, нужно отправить повторный запрос на /api/v1/auth/email/ со своими username и email
